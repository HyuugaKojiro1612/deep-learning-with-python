    "# 5.1 Introduction to convnets\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re about to dive into the theory of what convnets are and why they have been so successful at computer vision tasks. But first, let’s take a practical look at a simple convnet example. It uses a convnet to classify MNIST digits, a task we performed in chapter 2 using a densely connected network (our test accuracy then was 97.8%). Even though the convnet will be basic, its accuracy will blow out of the water that of the densely connected model from chapter 2.\n",
    " \n",
    " The following lines of code show you what a basic convnet looks like. It’s a stack of `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers. You’ll see in a minute exactly what they do.\n",
    " \n",
    "### *Instantiating a small convnet*\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, a convnet takes as input tensors of shape `(image_height, image_width, image_channels)` (not including the batch dimension). In this case, we’ll configure the convnet to process inputs of size `(28, 28, 1)`, which is the format of MNIST\n",

    "Whereas the densely connected network from chapter 2 had a test accuracy of 97%, the basic convnet has a test accuracy of 99%.\n",
    "But why does this simple convnet work so well, compared to a densely connected model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental difference between a densely connected layer and a convolution layer is this: `Dense` layers learn global patterns in their input feature space (for example, for a MNIST digit, patterns involving all pixels), whereas convolution layers learn local patterns: in the case of images, patterns found in small 2D windows of the inputs. In the previous example, these windows were all 3 × 3. Images can be broken into local patterns such as edges, textures, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This key characteristic gives convnets two interesting properties:\n",
    "- *The patterns they learn are translation invariant*. After learning a certain pattern in the lower-right corner of a picture, a convnet can recognize it anywhere: for example, in the upper-left corner. A densely connected network would have to learn the pattern anew if it appeared at a new location. This makes convnets data efficient when processing images (because the visual world is fundamentally translation invariant): they need fewer training samples to learn representations that have generalization power.\n",
    "- *They can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns*. A first convolution layer will learn small local patterns such as edges, a second convolution layer will learn larger patterns made of the features of the first layers, and so on. This allows convnets to efficiently learn increasingly complex and abstract visual concepts (because the visual world is fundamentally spatially hierarchical)."
